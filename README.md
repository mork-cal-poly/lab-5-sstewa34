View full instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zv2180DkNRuQybnAWZ5Ui7G-_Nca7k7CfRz9qAf0nEU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Part 1

Create organic, generative art.

- create a design (in a function)
- use `noLoop()` in setup
- have a loop in `draw()` which calls your function many times
- each time you call the function, provide it randomly generated arguments

## Part 2

Create structured, generative art.

- create a design (in a function)
- use `noLoop()` in setup
- have a loop in `draw()` which calls your function many times
- each time you call the function, provide it at least one randomly generated value and one mathematically generated value
